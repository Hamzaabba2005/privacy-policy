    <h1>Privacy Policy for CheckMyPlate</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use the CheckMyPlate app.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>CheckMyPlate does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data. When you enter a vehicle registration number, we use this input to provide vehicle details in real-time, but no data is stored or retained after the request is processed.</p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The registration number you input is used solely to fetch and display vehicle information, such as make, model, and year. We do not store, share, or reuse this data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>CheckMyPlate may use third-party services to retrieve vehicle information. These third-party services are responsible for their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those services for more information.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>While CheckMyPlate does not store your data, we implement industry-standard measures to protect the communication between the app and the data services it uses.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to review it periodically.</p>
